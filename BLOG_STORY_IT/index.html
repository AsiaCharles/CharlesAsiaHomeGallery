                    Have you ever wondered what it's like to <strong>grow up surrounded by technology</strong>? Growing up, my family is already into <strong>technology stuff</strong>. I use the television a lot and using the desktop computers. I spent time using these devices on my free time after school. From an early age my brothers already showed me <strong>the internet during childhood</strong> like games and social media.

                <h3>Curiosity of the IT Devices</h3>
                <p>
                    During my childhood, I already <strong>explore the different types of devices</strong>, such as desktop, smartphones, the peripherals, and game consoles. I remember playing with these devices and doing some experimenting, such as <strong>looking through settings and learning the shortcuts</strong> on these devices. I really do not fully understand on them, but I do research of their purpose. My experience of these devices are positive, by playing games, by experience on my own I learned this stuff to my brothers by doing <strong>the simple movement through the games using the WASD movement on the keyboard keys and mouse control</strong> on the desktop. On the gaming consoles I do not play much of it, because I learned the mouse and keyboard on gaming. I make mistakes of the control like smashing them together, and not knowing how to move my character. On my opinion <strong>exploring devices help my journey on the long way</strong> and experience on types of devices build confidence on the internet world.

                <h3>Entertainment on IT devices</h3>
                <p>
                    Using these devices causes me to <strong>pay more attention to them than the television</strong> at home. I started watching on <strong>YouTube, Netflix, and Instagram Reels</strong>, these changed my attention span and free time. I choose to watch the content that I am interested in so I can fix the recommendations on my feed. But other than that, not only do I use these applications for entertainment, but I also use them for education, like <strong>solving math equations through YouTube</strong>. This experience has also made me realise that, even though I get distracted easily, these apps can have <strong>learning experiences as well, not just for entertainment</strong>. Reflecting on these actions, I see <strong>the balancing of entertainment and learning</strong> while using these applications.

                <h3>Daily life on IT devices</h3>
                <p>
                    In my daily life, these devices play a <strong>huge role in how I communicate, relax, and entertain myself</strong>. I use these devices every day at home and at school. I also use these devices outside, for <strong>communication to my friends and family through messaging apps or social media</strong>. This makes me think that, these devices and applications make my life easier for communicating to my friends and family. Looking back, this became my habit on my daily life instead of going out like good old days. In my opinion, these devices are <strong>helpful in my daily life</strong>, as long I am not too distracted on the applications and <strong>take responsibility of it</strong>.

        <h2>Present: Using the current Devices</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                At present, I still use these IT devices and applications on my daily life. For me <strong>the technology has improved ever since childhood</strong> and throughout my teenage years, these improvement makes that <strong>IT is the future for society</strong>. Through my experiences these tools support us on <strong>learning, communicating, entertainment, and games with other people around the world</strong>. I choose the technology, because it helps me grow as a person even if it distracts me or not mindful on my habits. I plan to use the technology in a better way by <strong>balancing it, to make sure have a positive life and experience</strong>. Moving forward, I am still studying about these technology in school so I can have plans in the future, these devices are the future in life, not just for me but to everyone, people should have responsibility to use this. By using these I can <strong>balance my life and be focus on my studies</strong>.
